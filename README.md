# האפליקציה של ליה (Lia's App)

A Hebrew early-speech practice app built for a single child, grounded in
real speech-language-pathology techniques for late talkers. It runs as an
installable PWA with **no backend, no accounts, and no network required
after first load** — every word tap, recording, and setting lives in
IndexedDB on the child's own device.

> תרגום קצר: אפליקציית PWA לתרגול דיבור בעברית לילדה קטנה, מבוססת על שיטות
> קליניות לעיכוב שפה (גירוי ממוקד, זיהוי לפני הפקה, זוגות מינימליים ועוד).
> הכול רץ במכשיר בלבד — בלי שרת, בלי חשבון, בלי אינטרנט אחרי הטעינה הראשונה.

## Who this is for

- **Product / non-technical readers** — read "What the app does" and
  "Feature tour" below to understand the experience end to end without
  opening the code.
- **Developers** — the whole app is one `index.html` (vanilla JS, no
  build step, no framework). Read "Architecture" and "Repo layout" before
  touching code.

## What the app does

Lia's App teaches a young child (the app is literally addressed to her —
"היי ליה!") her first spoken words in Hebrew. The core loop is: tap a
picture → hear the word spoken aloud (real recorded voice if a parent
recorded one, otherwise Hebrew text-to-speech) → repeat it back. On top of
that vocabulary loop sit two families of activities:

1. **Games** — arcade-style word games (quiz, memory, matching, etc.)
   that reinforce vocabulary the child already has some exposure to.
2. **Speech practice** — six activities modeled directly on techniques a
   speech-language pathologist would use with a late-talking toddler
   (see "The clinical method" below). These aren't generic edutainment;
   each one maps to a named intervention technique with a research basis,
   and that mapping is explained in-app on the parent screen so a parent
   (or an actual SLP) can see exactly what's being practiced and why.

A **parent screen**, gated behind a simple math problem so a toddler can't
wander in, gives caregivers control: settings, real voice recording,
adding personal/family words, a progress report, and a plain-language
explanation of the method. Everything — progress, settings, custom words,
voice recordings — exports to a single JSON backup file, because the
device is the only copy of the data.

## Feature tour

### Vocabulary categories
Ten built-in categories, each a themed set of illustrated word tiles:
חַיּוֹת (animals), אוֹכֶל (food), צְבָעִים וְצוּרוֹת (colors & shapes),
בַּבַּיִת (home), מִשְׁפָּחָה (family), הַגּוּף (body), פְּעוּלוֹת
(actions), מִסְפָּרִים (numbers), בַּחוּץ (outside), and רְגָשׁוֹת
(emotions) — plus **הַמִּלִּים שֶׁלִּי** ("my words"), a category built
entirely from words a parent adds (see below). Tapping any tile speaks the
word and marks it "learned" with a sticker; the home screen shows a
progress bar per category.

### Flashcards
A swipe-through, one-word-at-a-time card view for focused repetition,
separate from the tap-grid.

### Games (arcade-style vocabulary reinforcement)
| Game | What happens |
|---|---|
| 🎧 איפה ה...? (Quiz) | Hear a word, tap the matching picture |
| 🃏 משחק זיכרון (Memory) | Classic pairs match — picture ↔ word |
| 🙈 מה נעלם? (Missing) | Spot which picture disappeared |
| 🔗 חיבורים (Match) | Draw a line from word to picture |
| 🎤 תגידי את זה (Speech) | Say the word out loud; speech recognition checks it |
| 🖼️ כרטיסיות (Cards) | Flashcard mode, launched as a "game" from the menu |
| 🫧 בועות מילים (Bubbles) | Pop bubbles, hear the word behind each one |
| 🐮 מי אמר את זה? (Sounds) | Hear an animal sound, find the right animal |
| 🔢 כמה יש? (Count) | Count items, pick the matching number |
| 📦 לאיזו קופסה? (Sort) | Sort pictures into the right category |

### Speech practice — the clinical method
Six activities under "תרגול דיבור", each tied to a named early-intervention
technique for late talkers (explained in full, in Hebrew, on the parent
screen's "השיטה" tab):

| Activity | Technique | Idea |
|---|---|---|
| 🎯 מילה במיקוד (Focused word) | Focused stimulation | One target word modeled ~8 times across short natural sentences |
| 👉 תראי לי (Show me) | Receptive identification | No speech required — child points; difficulty (2→3→4 options) only increases after 3 correct in a row |
| ⏸️ משלימים ביחד (Fill it in) | Expectant delay / cloze | A familiar sentence stops one word short, then 5 seconds of silence with an expectant look |
| 🫙 הצנצנת (The jar) | Communication temptation | A desirable object requires the child to initiate — any attempt counts (word, syllable, sound, or tap) |
| 👂 דומה אבל לא (Similar but not) | Minimal pairs | Distinguishing words that differ by one sound (עֵץ/עֵז, יָד/יָם) at the listening stage, before production |
| ➕ שתי מילים (Two words) | Semantic expansion / recast | Core words ("more", "no more", "big", "mine") get recast into a full sentence on every choice |

The in-app explanation is explicit that **the app supports practice, it
does not replace a speech-language pathologist** — if there's a real
concern about speech delay, it says to get evaluated.

### Adaptive word selection
Games don't pick words uniformly at random. `weightedPick()` is a
lightweight spaced-repetition heuristic: words the child has gotten wrong
more often are weighted to appear more; words seen many times recently are
weighted down; a little randomness keeps it from feeling mechanical. The
parent report surfaces the resulting "words worth reviewing" list.

### Personalization
Parents can add custom words with a photo (or emoji) and a real voice
recording — e.g. a grandparent's name, a neighbor's dog, a favorite toy —
so the vocabulary isn't limited to generic stock categories. Real recorded
voice is preferred everywhere over synthesized TTS when available, because
a familiar voice works better for a child than a robotic one.

### Parent screen
Long-press the 👤 icon and solve a random one-digit multiplication problem
to get in (keeps a toddler out, not a determined adult). Five tabs:
- **⚙️ הגדרות (Settings)** — speech rate, niqqud (vowel points) on/off,
  background music + volume, feedback sounds, confetti/animation effects,
  install prompt, backup/restore, progress reset.
- **🎙️ הקלטות (Recordings)** — record real voice per word, per category,
  play back or delete.
- **💜 מילים שלי (My words)** — add/remove custom words with photo + emoji.
- **📊 דוח (Report)** — per-category progress bars, total words learned,
  a "words to review" list driven by the same wrong-answer weighting used
  in games.
- **📚 השיטה (The method)** — the plain-language technique explanations
  described above.

### Data & backup
All state (learned words, per-word stats, settings, custom words, voice
recordings as blobs) lives in **IndexedDB** — nothing is ever sent over
the network. Export writes one JSON file with everything (recordings
included, base64-encoded); import supports merge or full replace. There is
no cloud sync, so **the on-device backup file is the only way data
survives a lost or reset device** — the app nags for this on the settings
tab.

### Installable PWA / offline
A service worker (`sw.js`) precaches the whole app shell cache-first, so
after the first load the app works with no network at all. It installs to
the home screen on Android (native prompt) and iOS (manual "Add to Home
Screen" — iOS never auto-prompts), launching full-screen with a splash
screen when opened from the home-screen icon rather than the browser.

### Platform differences
| Feature | Android/Chrome | iOS/Safari |
|---|---|---|
| Offline, install, icons, splash | ✅ | ✅ |
| Text-to-speech (Hebrew) | ✅ | ✅ (needs a Hebrew voice installed) |
| Voice recording | ✅ webm/opus | ✅ mp4/aac (auto-detected) |
| Speech recognition ("תגידי את זה", games needing mic input) | ✅ | ❌ not implemented in Safari |
| Wake lock (screen stays on) | ✅ | ⚠️ partial |

Speech-recognition-dependent games degrade gracefully on iOS rather than
breaking: "הצנצנת" still works via tap, "תגידי את זה" shows an explanation
instead of a broken mic prompt.

## Architecture

- **Single-file app.** `index.html` (~2,500 lines) contains all markup,
  CSS, and JS — no build step, no bundler, no framework, no npm
  dependencies for the app itself. Rendering is a hand-rolled
  `render()`/view-state pattern (`view = 'home' | 'category' | 'quiz' | ...`),
  not React/Vue/etc.
- **Storage.** IndexedDB via a small wrapper (`detect/get/set/del/keys`),
  used for progress, settings, custom words, per-word stats, and voice
  recordings.
- **Audio.** Web Speech API (`speechSynthesis`) for Hebrew TTS, falling
  back gracefully where unsupported; `MediaRecorder` for parent-recorded
  voice (format auto-detected per browser); Web Speech API
  `SpeechRecognition` for the games that listen for the child speaking
  (Chrome/Android only).
- **Offline.** `sw.js` is a cache-first service worker; bump `VERSION`
  inside it on every deploy to bust old caches (see "Updating" below).
- **Mascot & art.** כּוֹכִי the mascot and the category background
  patterns are inline SVG, generated by `tools/make_art.py` and pasted
  into a generated-art block at the top of `index.html`'s script — they
  are not separate asset files.
- **No backend, no accounts, no analytics, no ads, no external network
  calls at runtime.** This is a deliberate product constraint (see Kids
  category / app-store notes below), not just a current limitation.

```

## Running it locally

The app needs a secure context (service worker, mic access, and speech
recognition all require HTTPS or localhost) — opening `index.html` via
`file://` will not work correctly.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Tests & CI

A Playwright suite covers layout at four screen sizes, every category and
game opening, four games played to completion, IndexedDB persistence,
backup export/restore, and PWA basics (manifest, icons, service worker,
offline).

```bash
pip install playwright && python -m playwright install chromium
python3 -m http.server 8000 &
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 python3 tests/test_suite.py
```

`.github/workflows/test-and-deploy.yml` runs the suite on every push and
pull request. On `master`, a passing run deploys to GitHub Pages and
rewrites the service worker's cache version to the commit SHA so
returning devices always pick up the new build. Pages is configured
(Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions) and live at
https://yonicks.github.io/lia-app/. The repo is public, which GitHub
Pages requires on the free plan.

## Updating

Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` (e.g. `lia-v1` → `lia-v2`) on every deploy. Old
caches are purged on activation, and returning users see a "new version"
toast on next launch.

## Deploying elsewhere

- **Netlify Drop** — drag the folder onto https://app.netlify.com/drop.
  Free, HTTPS included, done in a minute.
- **GitHub Pages** — see "Tests & CI" above.

## Regenerating art & store assets

The mascot and category patterns are inline SVG generated by
`tools/make_art.py`; re-run it and paste the output over the
generated-art block at the top of `index.html`'s script. Store
screenshots are captured from the real running app rather than mocked, so
they can't drift from what actually ships:

```bash
python3 tools/make_store.py
```

## Backing up a child's data

Parent screen (long-press 👤 → solve the math problem) → ⚙️ הגדרות →
גיבוי ושחזור → ייצוא. This writes one JSON file with everything, including
voice recordings. **Do this after any recording session** — the device is
the only copy.

## Shipping to app stores (optional)

The web app can be wrapped for the Play Store / App Store without
rewriting anything.

### Android — Play Store via TWA
```bash
npm i -g @bubblewrap/cli
bubblewrap init --manifest https://YOUR-URL/manifest.json
bubblewrap build          # produces a signed .aab
```

### iOS — App Store via Capacitor
```bash
npm init -y && npm i @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init "Lia Words" com.yourname.liawords --web-dir=.
npx cap add ios && npx cap sync && npx cap open ios
```
Requires a Mac, Xcode, and an Apple Developer account ($99/yr). Apple
rejects thin web wrappers under guideline 4.2 — the offline mode,
microphone recording, and local-only storage are the native-value story
to lead with in a review submission.

### Kids category requirements (both stores)
- A privacy policy URL is mandatory.
- No third-party analytics, no ads, no external links — the app has none
  of these today, so this is a constraint to preserve, not a TODO.
- Google Play Data Safety form: declare **no data collected, no data
  shared** — literally true, since nothing ever leaves the device.
